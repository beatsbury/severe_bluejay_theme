# Severe Bluejay

## to whomever this may be of any concern

"Severe Bluejay" is a steampunk-inspired theme and a fork of a great ["Grueling Hare" theme by pureux](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pureux.grueling-hare). I find this variant to be more peaceful and less rusty, among other things.
